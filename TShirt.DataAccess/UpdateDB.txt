1) Go Tool -> NuGet Package Manager -> Open Package Manager Console - ensure Default Project dropdown at the top is the correct one
2) Create Model with related attributes
3) Type: add-migration NameOfMigration
4) Type: update-database

If the database become corrupted, delete the migration folder all together in the solution and remove the DB in SSMS
Never remove a specific migration that has already been applied, because it will disturb the pipepine and corrupt all your migrations. The previous is not a solution
for production data.
Only modify migrations if you know what you are doing
